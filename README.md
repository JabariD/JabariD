Howdy, I am Payton, a senior Computer Science major @ Howard University. My bread and butter is building/working on large-scale backend software engineering systems. But I also like to wear many hats all the way from full stack applications, web/backend/mobile development, crypto, AI and anything software development really.

You can always catch me learning something new. I sometimes gather my thoughts to write abount things that strike my fancy, check it out [here](https://medium.com/@JabariD "here").
- ðŸ”­ I am currently learning the foundational principles of software engineering
- ðŸŒ± I am slowly getting into Blockchain, AI, and large scale systems in SWE.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about under technical internships, FAANG, sports or anything related to sports
- ðŸ“« Lets connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/payton-d-78a7a2171/ "LinkedIn")!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once found a spider with me while showering. Lets just say only one of us made it out of there alive.
