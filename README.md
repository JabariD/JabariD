I'm Payton and I'm currently a junior in college. I like to wear many hats all the way from full stack applications to competitive programming. You can always catch me learning something new. Here's my blog https://medium.com/@JabariD and YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxhUW6cZDuHg3z9SAy6Fdew.
